# SI4732 Mini Radio Resources

Welcome to the **SI4732 Mini Radio** repository! This repository serves as a central hub for links, files, and documentation related to the **SI4732 DSP radio module**. The hardest was getting the files from OSHWHub, as you need an account, and an account requires a Chinese phone number….which is hard to get if you live in the US. Apparently….very hard.

## 📁 Repository Contents
This repository includes:

- 🔧 **Firmware & Code**: Example firmware, libraries, and Arduino sketches.
- 📡 **Hardware Resources**: Schematic diagrams, PCB layouts, and module pinouts.
- 🔗 **External Links**: These are links for various files including the hard ones to get from OSHWHub, STL files, etc..
